The removal of dead plant material, storm damaged limbs, weak or diseased branches, or densely overgrown limbs can greatly enhance the health and aesthetics of your tree, especially if a pruning program is started when the tree is young.<\/p>\n<p>Proper pruning techniques started when the tree is young will help \u201ctrain\u201d the tree into forming a strong trunk and canopy. As the tree matures, the training it received early on will help keep it healthy and thus more resistant to pest and disease infestation and storm damage. If the tree is maintained properly from the beginning, the need for excessive pruning and costly maintenance will become less necessary as the tree grows.<\/p>\n<p>A <span class=\"treemasters\">TREEMASTERS<\/span> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.isa-arbor.com\/home.aspx\">I.S.A.

If your tree is young, starting an annual pruning plan now will help keep your tree beautiful and healthy as it matures, and will save you money on costly maintenance or tree removal down the road.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Q: What Is The Best Time Of Year For Pruning?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A: For some tree species, winter is the best time of year to prune dead or unnecessary branches. This is because these species are dormant during winter months and are storing their energy for new growth in the spring. Fall is also an appropriate time for pruning to remove dead growth and minimize potential winter storm damage. However, most trees in the Bay Area can be pruned year-round, and an annual pruning maintenance program is the most effective way to keep your trees strong and healthy.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Q: What Is Topping And Why Is It A Bad Idea?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A: Tree topping is the practice of chopping off the highest portions of new limb growth back to larger branches; usually in order reduce the size of the tree. Many people believe that by reducing the height of a tree by topping, they are reducing the hazard to their property. In fact, topping can create a larger hazard by reducing foliage needed by the tree to produce food, causing the tree to weaken and become more susceptible to pest and disease attack. This can potentially lead to limb failure or tree death, creating a danger to your family and property. Topping is not an acceptable method of tree pruning, and is not recommended by <span class=\"treemasters\">TREEMASTERS<\/span>.<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"fusion-clearfix\"><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"parent":0,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":{"footnotes":""},"class_list":["post-1212","page","type-page","status-publish","hentry"],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v25.1 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Treemasters - Tree &amp; Shrub Pruning Services &amp; FAQ<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"TREE &amp; SHRUB PRUNING Pruning is one of the most common and effective methods of maintaining a healthy, beautiful and safe tree.
