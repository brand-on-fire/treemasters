In addition, each piece of equipment is inspected, serviced, and cleaned each night by our trained staff of mechanics to prevent costly down time at your jobsite and reduce the risk of bringing harmful contaminants onto your property.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"treemasters\">TREEMASTERS<\/span> takes pride in our commitment to offering the highest quality tree care to our valued clients, and the skilled operation of our specialized machinery is a large part of that commitment. All of our operators are trained and certified in the safe handling and operation of these machines.<\/p>\n<p>For more information about our equipment, please read the brief descriptions below.<\/p>\n<p><strong>CHIPPERS<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"treemasters\">TREEMASTERS<\/span> uses high-powered, large capacity wood chippers for all of our tree and brush chipping. Currently, we operate chippers from Vermeer Inc. The largest of these chippers, the BC2000XL , is fed via a large grapple arm and has a chipping capacity of 20 inches.<\/p>\n<p><strong>TRACK LOADERS<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"treemasters\">TREEMASTERS<\/span> operates two compact track loaders from Bobcat Company. The larger of our machines, the T300, is an 81hp Diesel loader with a bucket width of 80 inches. Our smaller machine, the T300\u2019s little brother, is the Bobcat MT52 Mini Track Loader. This walk-behind unit will fit into almost any restricted jobsite with a bucket width of only 36 inches. Both loaders are equipped with grapple buckets to help quickly remove brush and debris from a jobsite.<\/p>\n<p><strong>CRANE TRUCKS<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The backbone of <span class=\"treemasters\">TREEMASTERS<\/span>\u2019 tree care operations is our crane trucks. These mobile high-capacity cranes allow us to remove large trees or branches from your property safely and efficiently. Our largest crane, the Terex Stinger BT \/ RS 70100, is a 30-ton capacity crane with a maximum reach of 156 feet. Only certified crane operators use our cranes in order to ensure the safe and professional completion of your project.<\/p>\n<p><strong>STUMP GRINDERS<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"treemasters\">TREEMASTERS<\/span> operates only high quality stump grinding equipment to ensure your project is completed safely and efficiently. Our largest stump cutter, the Vermeer SC60TX, is a hydraulic self-propelled track mounted machine with a 24\u201d diameter-cutting wheel. Our smaller, tight access machines manufactured by Rayco Manufacturing allow us to access even the hardest to reach areas of your property.<\/p>\n<p><strong>BUCKET TRUCKS<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Often, tree work requires sending a worker high off the ground into the canopy of a large tree. In situations where a climber may not be feasible, <span class=\"treemasters\">TREEMASTERS<\/span> operates a 65\u2019 high-reach bucket truck to access those hard to reach places.<\/p>\n<p><strong>DUMP TRUCKS<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"treemasters\">TREEMASTERS<\/span> operates several sizes of debris dump trucks, from 12 to 25 yard capacity, to contain and haul all of the chipped wood and brush we remove from a property. Without them, cleanup would be costly and time consuming. Once these trucks are full of chipped debris, we deliver the wood chips to our customers who use them for ground cover, erosion control, and organic compost.<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"fusion-clearfix\"><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"parent":0,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":{"footnotes":""},"class_list":["post-1231","page","type-page","status-publish","hentry"],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v25.1 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Treemasters - Specialized Quality Equipment<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"TREEMASTERS takes pride in our commitment to offering the highest quality tree care.
